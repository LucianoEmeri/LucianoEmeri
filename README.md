<h2 align="center"> ❓ &nbsp;About me:</h2>

<h4 align="center">
After working for 5 years in a furniture factory, specifically in the stock area utilizing Odoo, I decided to take a leap of faith and pursue a career in web design, leaving my job to fully dedicate my time to programming. My passion for computer science began when I was 10 years old. Upon finishing high school, I studied computer repair. Additionally, I have been producing electronic music since I was 17, and at the same time, I founded a sound and lighting company for social events, which has kept me constantly engaged with technology.

I am a detail-oriented person with a knack for autonomous learning. From an early age, I taught myself how to use music editing software, as well as photo and video editing tools. Now, at 25, I am determined to give my all to improve my skills as a developer and make a living doing what I love.
</p>
<br>
Starting in March 2024, I enrolled in a programming bootcamp where I learned to use the most current tools in the market, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I specialized in frontend with technologies like React, Redux, and Next.js. Additionally, I worked with modern tools like Tailwind CSS for design, TypeScript for safer typing, Express for handling the backend, and Vercel for deploying applications. Today, I am exploring job opportunities as a developer to showcase the skills I have acquired.
